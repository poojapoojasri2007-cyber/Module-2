# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a=16 

print(bin(a)
```



## Output
<img width="697" height="319" alt="{47E9D9F4-09A3-40C0-A7E7-EE92FA819B10}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6ce7d32-2271-41a3-9bf0-0b084b2eda1e" />


## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
