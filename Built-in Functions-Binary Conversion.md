# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a=16 

print(bin(a)
```

## Output
<img width="668" height="317" alt="{8132C343-181B-475F-A496-A4A5332A08C9}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/203bca47-5cd6-4931-a524-b6b50996381a" />

## Result
Thus, the program has been successfully executed.
